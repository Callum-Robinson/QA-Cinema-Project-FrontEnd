          <p>
            Here at QA Cinemas, our goal was to create a functional web
            application where you can book your favourite new film releases to
            go watch at our fantastic theatre, with also the option to have the
            chance to see films from the past you'd like to experience in a
            cinema again.
          </p>
          <p>
            QA Cinmas specialises in showcasing films that are highly
            rated and also has a range of different blockbuster films from the past such as The Godfather, Pulp Fiction and so much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are proud to have created QA Cinemas and hope you enjoy using our
            site.
