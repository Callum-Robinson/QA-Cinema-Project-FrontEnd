      <h3> Classifications Rules </h3>

      <p>
        <hr /> Age ratings are recommendations for parents and carers to help
        them decide what is appropriate for their child depending on what stage
        of development they are at. Legally, these must be followed by cinemas,
        and no one under the age of 12, 15 or 18 can purchase a film with those
        ratings. However, what you choose to watch at home with your children is
        up to you.

        {" "}
        Ratings info provides a short description of the issues contained in a
        film, on video or DVD, and this appears on the black card shown on the
        cinema screen before a film starts. Youâ€™ll also see it on film posters,
        listings and DVD packaging, and on some video on demand (VoD) services,
        such as Netflix. And we publish a longer, fuller version on our website
        and app. Search by title or browse our titles database.
