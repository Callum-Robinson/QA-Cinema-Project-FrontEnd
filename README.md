# QA Cinema Project

This is the final project of the 22FebEnable3 cohort (Team Air) and the goal was to create a
full stack web application for a client called QA Cinemas

This is the front-end of the application and the goal was to create an attractive and interactive website providing the wanted information and functionality for QA Cinemas

The back-end can be found here: https://github.com/Mohab-Khalifa/QA-Cinema-Project-BackEnd

The Jira planning board for this project can be found here: https://mohabk.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/FPC/boards/7/roadmap
